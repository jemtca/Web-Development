    <p>I say to myself often that I do not want to think forward because people who think too far, sometimes they forget what is in the middle. So I do everything with philosophy and in easy way, trying my best day by day, making some progress daily that it helps to see my final goal closer and closer.</p>

    <p>If I think deeply, I would like to see myself finishing the co-op and later having the chance to work in Vancouver for few years. Get some experience and some knowlodge that provides me enough confidence to apply for an eager job position, either in Vancouver or in any other city in Canada.</p>
