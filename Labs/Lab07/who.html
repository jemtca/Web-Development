    <p>My name is Jesús and I am from Spain. I currenly live in Vancouver where I am studying a co-op diploma, Web and Mobile Application Development, at CICCC (Cornerstone International Community College of Canada).</p>
	<p>I studied computer science engineering for five years at the university of my city and when I got graduated I moved to New York City for two years to improve my english, but I did not want to forget what I studied, so I did some moocs and I kept learning by myself in my free time.</p>
	<p>Then I moved back to Spain where I worked for several months and after that I went to London with a friend for few months to look for a job there, but at the same I already had the plan to go to Canada, so it was about time to come back to Spain one more time to start planning everything.</p>
